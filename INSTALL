VDT plugin uses modified VEditor plugin for Eclipse and because of the license incompatibility
(Eclipse Public License v1.0 for VEditor and GNU General Public License v3.0+ for VDT plugin)
it is not possible to distribute a pre-compiled version (.jar file), so the plugin code has to be
merged (using provided script) and compiled/built as Eclipse plugin project. To do this you
will need "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers", currently tested version is "Kepler".

VDT plugin may (and likely will) interfere with another VEditor installation, so if you have it
in your system you will need to run a different copy of Eclipse environment that does not have
VEditor.

  1) Clone VDT source code from the Git repository.
  2) Run
./install_and_patch_veditor.sh
in the top directory of vdt-plugin. This will clone the original VEditor source tree
as tmp/unmodified_veditor_1_2_0_clone, re-organize files to match VDT plugin code tree, apply
patch and copy the produced files to VDT project locations (most under src/com/elphel/vdt/veditor
and _generated), these files/directories are listed in .gitignore . When VEditor-related part
of the VDT code will be changed (and so the vdt-veditor.patch) you will need to run
./install_and_patch_veditor.sh again
  3) Import the VDT plugin project into the Eclipse workspace.

  4) In the "Package Explorer" window, expand the 'com.elphel.vdt' folder and double-click
     the 'plugin.xml' file.

  5) Select the "Overview" tab at the bottom of the appeared window.

  6) Under the "Testing" label, click the "Launch an Eclipe application" link.
     A new instance of Eclipse shall be run.

  7) Now play with the plugin. To open the main perspective, select from the main menu
     "Window" -> "Open Perspective" -> "Other" -> "Verilog".
Having two Eclipse instances (one with VDT plugin source code and the other with Verilog development 
allows to monitor and debug plugin errors.
